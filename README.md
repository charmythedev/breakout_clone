# Breakout Clone (Pygame)

A Breakout-style arcade game built in Python using Pygame, focused on real-time collision detection, game loops, and player input handling.

---

## 🎮 What This Project Does
This project recreates the classic Breakout game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and destroy bricks. The game tracks collisions, handles user input in real time, and updates game state smoothly at a fixed frame rate.

## ✨ Key Features
- Real-time paddle movement using keyboard input
- Ball physics with wall, paddle, and brick collision detection
- Brick grid generation and removal on collision
- Frame-rate–controlled game loop
- Modular class-based structure (Ball, Paddle, Brick)
